* PAV2023 Course Project

    The project builds a tool to statically perform a points-to
    analysis for the JAVA programs.

    We will use the static analysis framework Soot to build the
    analysis.


**  Soot package
    The soot jar to use is present in the `pkgs` dir. We have tested
    the build on JAVA 8 and hence its preferable to use the same for
    the further build steps. Google for how to download the JAVA 8
    binaries and install it at your respective home,

**  Install Dependencies
    Install Graphviz (optional)
    Graphviz is used for generating the diagram.

    #+begin_src shell
      apt install graphviz
    #+end_src

**  Running the Analysis
    + After cloning the repo
      #+begin_src shell
        cd <project-dir>
        make
      #+end_src


** Build steps
    + To recompile the targets (ie, the target classes, aka test inputs):
      #+begin_src  shell
        make build-targets
      #+end_src

    + To recompile the Analysis:

      #+begin_src shell
        make build-analysis
      #+end_src

    + To run the analysis and generate the CFG diagram:

      #+begin_src shell
        make run-analysis
      #+end_src

** Adding your own test cases
    + Public test cases are kept in the "targets1-pub" directory.
    + You may add new test cases in  the "target2-mine" directory.


** Important code files
    + Analysis.java  -- main file. implement your analysis in this file
    + PAVBase.java -- auxiliary file. used to provide utility functions.
    + LatticeElement.java -- the LatticeElement interface definition
