### Create a branch

After cloning the repo, if you need to work on a feature, please create a branch with command

`git checkout -b <email>/<feature>`

for example, `git checkout -b avinashd/single-thread`

### Update and test your code

Commit your code on this branch after testing your feature.

### Push and create a pull request

Push your code to the remote repository on the same branch and create a pull request from your branch to the master.

### Few notes

It would be useful to add your experiment results and code change info in the CHANGELOG.md, which would help in writing the report.
